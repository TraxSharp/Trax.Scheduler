/// per item through the <c>configureEach</c> callback of
/// <see cref="Services.TraxScheduler.ITraxScheduler.ScheduleManyAsync"/>. For a single manifest, set
/// the same values through <see cref="ScheduleOptions"/>.
/// </remarks>
/// <example>
/// <code>
/// await scheduler.ScheduleManyAsync&lt;ISyncTableTrain, SyncTableInput, Unit, string&gt;(
///     tables,
///     table => ($"sync-{table}", new SyncTableInput { Table = table }),

///     {
///         opts.MaxRetries = table == "orders" ? 5 : 3;
