/// Deletes expired metadata and associated work queue entries and log entries for whitelisted train types.

/// <remarks>
/// Deletes in configurable batches (default: 1000 rows) to limit row-level lock duration.
/// Each batch loads metadata IDs first, then clears back-references, deletes owned FK rows,
/// and deletes the metadata by ID. The junction loops until no more expired rows remain.
///
/// Internal scheduler trains (JobDispatcher, ManifestManager, MetadataCleanup, DeadLetterCleanup,
/// JobRunner) are always eligible regardless of the configured whitelist. The dispatcher alone
/// persists a metadata row every poll, so leaving these out lets the table grow without bound.
///
/// Trains added with a retention of their own are swept at that cutoff instead of the configured
/// default. Trains sharing a cutoff are swept together, so the batching below runs once per
/// distinct retention rather than once in total.
///
/// Only metadata in a terminal state (Completed, Failed, or Cancelled) is eligible for deletion,
/// and not while a queued work queue entry or another run names it in <c>replay_decisions_of</c>
/// (central <c>docs/0041</c>).
/// A batch that fails (for example an unexpected foreign-key reference) is bisected to isolate the
/// offending row, which is logged and skipped so one bad row can never abort the whole sweep.
